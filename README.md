Contains the homework assignment for the web-design-challenge. 

The webpage can be found at:

This respository uses the visuals created for the WeatherPy assignment. Using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap, the visuals and a brief analysis are hosted on a github page.

NOTE:
The CSS script does not appear to be styling the webpage when hosted on github, but does provide styling when run from my local machine. All related files and pathing has been updated for github, but the github page is not displaying the CSS styling. Images of the webpage as it appears when run locally are provided to demonstrate that the design elements of the assignment were completed.
